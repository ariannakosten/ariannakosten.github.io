For my second portfolio project I created an app called Site Stash! This was built on the framework of MVC (Model, View, Controller) using Sinatra & Active Record for database support. This framework allows for ‘separation of concerns’ by associating a files function’s with their responsibility and how those files correspond with one another. 

My Site Stash App allows for the creation of user accounts by signing up, logging in, and logging out. With the use of ‘sessions’ I was able to create a hash which essentially stored a user’s inputted data securely on the server. When a user creates an account or logs in: their session is created, password is encrypted, and they are given a unique id that is specific to their duration in the app. They then are able to utilize CRUD actions by creating, reading, updating, or deleting their stored links. 

Overall, this project was challenging—in a good way. Even after about 2.5 months, I am impressed with my ability to build a simple website from nothing. Although I still have a long way to go, it’s pretty neat (and sometimes downright frustrating) to see and figure out how everything is connected in an app like this. I’ve seen how Sinatra & Active Record offer a lot of functionality that make certain functions a lot easier which is definitely a plus! Going into the next project I hope to be able to include more CSS and styling in my application for the sake of it not looking so plain and of course be able to talk through my code like pro—which seems to still be the biggest struggle for me thus far.
