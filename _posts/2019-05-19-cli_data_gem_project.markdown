For my first project with Flatiron school, I chose to display the top 30 attractions in the Bahamas–maybe because I wish I was already a wiz at coding and could be on a vacation there!

Anyways, I decided to scrape my data off a familiar travel website, TripAdvisor, and output important details like: the price, the catagory it was listed under, the description, & the rating it received by users.

I set up a prompt to welcome the user to my program and then asked them which attraction they would like to see more details on. The user could then pick their choice based off the attractions assigned index. This would then bring up the attraction and output all of the information I scraped in my Scraper class. From here, the user can choose to view the list again (and pick another attraction to view details on) or exit entirely.

I’d say the entire project took me about 2 to 3 days to build. While this might seem long to veteran coders, it was rewarding to me since I am someone who has never touched coding before. :)

Overall I found this project pretty challenging nonetheless, I spent a lot of time reviewing course material, Googling and asking questions when I was stuck. I think the thing I learned most about this project was how to use “pry”. Which is great because up until now, Ive been kind of “iffy” on how to use it correctly. Within my project I tested everything! It was nice to see exactly what certain methods where receiving versus what I intitally thought they would.

While I know I still have lots of room for improvment, I am feeling accomplished that I had just enough knowledge to be able to build my own working CLI and looking forward to learning more during my time with Flatiron!
