My name is Arianna Kosten and I'm a 28 year-old living in the rainy-yet beautiful city of Seattle, Washington. What brought me here is surely not unusual compared to others looking for a change in career. I currently have a Bachelors degree in Communications & Marketing and had a great job as a Marketing Director. While, I enjoyed my job I always felt as though I was not being challenged enough. After talking to a couple people in the Computer Science field and researching it on my own, I was hooked! I had to learn coding! After looking around at some of the competitive bootcamps in the area,  I am happy to have landed here at Flatiron and looking forward to the challenge ahead!
